2.A var variable can be redeclared and updated.

ex.function ofnumbers(){
  var a =10;
  console.log(a);  // output 10
  if(true){
   var a=20;
   console.log(a); // output 20
  }
  console.log(a);  // output 20
}

2.let:

2.A let variable be be updated but not redeclared.

ex.function ofnumbers(){
  let a =10;
  let a =20; //throws syntax error
  console.log(a); 
}

3.const: 
1.The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const” is limited to the block defined by curly braces. However if a variable is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned.
“const” cannot be re-assigned to a new value. However it CAN be mutated.
